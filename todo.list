What this project is about:

As avid Linux and AMD fan I was thoroughly disappointed to learn that multi-monitor setups are constantly 
breaking when using the amdgpu driver. Since I want to use my all AMD Workstation as the power user (and lifter)
I am, I do attempt to fix the kernel. Since I'm just starting out as developer and have just a tiny bit of experience
with the C programming language this is a huge and enormous task. But as we all know:

You grow with the challenges you face.
